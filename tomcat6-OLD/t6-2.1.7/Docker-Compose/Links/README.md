/!\ This is a docker file without the multihost networking (since version 1.10 of Docker and 1.6 of docker-compose).

The following docker-compose.yml file will use the deprecated **--link** option. If you are using a version >= 1.10 of Docker, you should use the docker-compose.yml file in the Network folder
